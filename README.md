# SENTIMENT ANALYSIS PROGRAM

## Purpose
To create a machine learning model that can recognize various emotions in text (possibly) beyond positive, negative, and neutral sentiment. As well as, a user-friendly web app that runs the model and can analyze the emotional content of text input, providing a useful tool for users.

## Goal
By the middle of June, I'd like to at least have a running program that can analyze text and _at least_ recognize the difference between positive, negative, and neutral sentiment. 

I don't expect my code to be entirely completed, nor perfect, but I'm still confident that I will be able to learn a lot from my journey.  


## Technology Used
- Python is used extensively in this project, specifically for the development of the sentiment analysis model
- The Natural Language Toolkit and other open-source libraries in Python will be used to preprocess the text data, extract relevant features, and train the machine learning model
- For web development popular frameworks such as Flask or Django will be used
